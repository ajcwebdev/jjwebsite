          I specialize in making technology human â€” enabling developers to understand, adopt, and adore technical products. My work in the open-source community has helped me hone my developer skills, which has made it possible for me to transition from developer relations to full-time software development. Bringing prior skills in project management allows me to maintain highly organized planning and execution.
